# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
## By: BABARAN, David Emmanuel V.

### Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting

1. The use of science and technology with the help of DOST in agriculture. I found this interesting because you wouldn't really think that a third world country would resort to science and technology in the field of agriculture. But at the same time, I feel excited to see how this will turn out.

2. The use of solar power in giving more people and households access to electricity. Similar to the first point, it will be exciting to see how this will pan out in the future.

3. To encourage and invest more in sports.

### Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)

1. I found it weird that he didn't mention POGO during his State Of the Nation Address.

### Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)

I didn't really find the SONA good nor bad. This is because he said pretty much the basic things. He also just talked about his plans, and what he has done so far. But, was he even able to achieve all the plans he set in previous SONAs? I found some of his plans good, like investing in sports and mental health. 

Aside from this, his SONA was fine because he didn't address all the major problems in our country. Topics such as poverty, and the problems brought by POGO were not addressed. Lastly, I found this SONA fine because he said all the plans, and addressed most of the things he needed to. Now, he needs to execute those plans, which he wasn't able to do with some in previous SONAs. 

### What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?

Fine.
