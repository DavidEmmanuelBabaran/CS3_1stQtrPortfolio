# **Q1 End of Lessons Reflections**

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. The first topic I think I know well, is the one on variables declarations. This is because we also studied this already last SY for cpp, which is a bit similar to javascript. Due to this, it was a bit easier to understand the lesson.

2. The second topic I think I know well, is the logical operations topic. Similar to the first topic, the logical operators, comparison, and arithmetic operators, were already discussed a bit last SY. Though I still had to review my notes, since I forgot some parts.

3. Though this topic is pretty new to me, I feel like I understand this topic. This topic is about basic statements. Though, at first, I was a bit confused on the differences between console.log, document.write, alert, I eventually understood it, and understood the topic more.

4. Loop control structures was another topic I found a bit easy. Loops such as for, and while were taught to us last SY for cpp, and even then, I think I already understood the topic. For javascript, I just had to remember the basics, such as the start, condition and increment.

5. Lastly, the topic on control statements was another one I understood. Similar to the others, we learned some of the parts last SY, and I would say that I already understood this topic from last SY. Conditional statements such as the if, and if else, were similar to last SY.


## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. The first topic I think I need practice in is the one on arrays. Though we studied this a bit last SY, I still find it a bit challenging. Though, I am starting to get a better understanding of it.

2. Similar to arrays, I still find functions a bit challenging. Personally, I still get confused with the ways to declare a function, and how to call it. I still also find arrow functions, and anonymous functions confusing. 

3. Though I understand some loop control structures as the for and while loops, I still don't think I have mastered the other loops, such as the do while, and for in. Aside from this, I also find the nested loops a bit challenging, though I can do some excercises about it. I think I just need to practice this, and read more to master this topic. 

4. I also found the event handlers a bit confusing, such as the onclick and onload. I just don't think I was able to understand the learning guide that well. If I were to ask help, i think I would've understood this topic more.

5. Lastly, though I no longer find it hard or complicated, I found some parts in the comparison operators topic a bit hard. I used to find the === and !== a bit confusing. But now, I understand it much more. 


## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
* Personally, just like for any other subject, I just follow my "habbit" which is just to read/understand the lesson first, clarify any problems, then do practice exercises. My first step is to always read, and try to understand the lesson as much as I can, since this is a crucial part in understanding a topic. I also really think think consultation should help as well, because you get to ask help from your teacher, and clarify any misunderstanding. Lastly, I find practice exercises really helpful, since this is where you get to see if you actually understand the lesson. 


## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
* The first activity I found helpful were the ones where we had to share to the class what we learned about the topic, since we are put to the test to see what we actually understood. Second, was the one where we do the bonus tasks, since not only do we get bonus, but also the fact that this can also serve as practice. For the activities I found not as helpful, was the one where we had to work with our table to do a code on paper, since it wasn't really realistic, and second would be the one where we talk about advanced topics, since I would rather master the current topics first.
