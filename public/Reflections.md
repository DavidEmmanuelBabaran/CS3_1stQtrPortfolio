# **Q1 End of Lessons Reflections**

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. The first topic I think I know well, is the one on variables declarations. This is because we also studied this already last SY for cpp, which is a bit similar to javascript. Due to this, it was a bit easier to understand the lesson.

2. The second topic I think I know well, is the the logical operatoions topic. Similar to the first topic, the logical operators, comparison, and arithmetic operators, were already discussed a bit last SY. Though I still had to review my notes, since I forgot some parts.

3. Though this topic is pretty new to me, I feel like I understand this topic. This topic is about basic statements. Though, at first, I was a bit confused on the differences between console.log, document.write, alert, I eventually understood it, and understood the topic more.

4. Loop control structures was another topic I found a bit easy. Loops such as for, and while were taught to us last SY for cpp, and even then, I think I already understood the topic. For javascript, I just had to remember the basics, such as the start, condition and increment.

5. Lastly, the topic on control statements was another one I understood. Similar to the others, we learned some of the parts last SY, and I would say that I already understood this topic from last SY. Conditional statements such as the if, and if else, were similar to last SY.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. The first topic I think I need practice in is
